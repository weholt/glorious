Create a plugin system: 1) Define RulePlugin protocol with evaluate() method, 2) Auto-discover plugins in ~/.code-atlas/plugins/, 3) Allow registering via config. Example plugin: check for TODO comments, check for specific import patterns.

Users can't filter by file pattern, sort by different fields, or combine queries.
