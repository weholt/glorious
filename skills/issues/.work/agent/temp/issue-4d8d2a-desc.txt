**Current State:**
All CLI commands are defined in a single massive file (cli/app.py), making it extremely difficult to navigate and maintain.

**Problems:**
- Commands are not grouped by functionality
- File is too large to understand at a glance
- Testing individual command groups is complicated
- Violates modular design principles

**Recommended Structure:**

```
cli/
├── app.py          # Main Typer app (thin orchestrator)
├── commands/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── create.py   # create, create-epic
│   ├── list.py     # list, filter
│   ├── update.py   # update, edit
│   ├── delete.py   # delete, remove
│   ├── show.py     # show, display
│   ├── stats.py    # stats, analytics
│   └── graph.py    # graph, tree, dependencies
├── formatters/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── table.py
│   ├── json.py
│   └── graph.py
└── utils.py        # Shared CLI utilities
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create commands/ directory
2. Group related commands into modules
3. Each module exports a Typer sub-app
4. Main app.py imports and includes sub-apps
5. Update tests to match new structure

**Benefits:**
- Each module focuses on one area of functionality
- Easier to find and modify specific commands
- Better testability (can test command groups independently)
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features
