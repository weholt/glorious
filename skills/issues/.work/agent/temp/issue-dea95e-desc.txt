**Current State:**
The file `src/issue_tracker/cli/app.py` contains 3271 lines of code, which drastically exceeds best practice guidelines (files should typically be under 200-300 lines for maintainability).

**Problems:**
- Single file contains all CLI commands, formatters, utilities, and business logic
- Extremely difficult to navigate and maintain
- Violates Single Responsibility Principle
- Makes testing harder
- Increases risk of merge conflicts

**Recommended Solution:**
1. Create `cli/commands/` directory with separate modules:
   - `create.py` - Issue creation commands
   - `list.py` - Listing and filtering
   - `update.py` - Update operations
   - `delete.py` - Delete operations
   - `show.py` - Display commands
   - `stats.py` - Statistics and analytics
   - `graph.py` - Dependency graph operations
   
2. Create `cli/formatters/` for output formatting:
   - `table_formatter.py`
   - `json_formatter.py`
   - `graph_formatter.py`
   
3. Create `cli/utils.py` for shared CLI utilities

4. Keep `cli/app.py` as thin orchestrator (~100-150 lines max) that:
   - Imports command groups
   - Registers them with Typer app
   - Sets up global options

**Expected Outcome:**
- Each module under 300 lines
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to test individual command groups
- Better maintainability and readability
