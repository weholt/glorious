**Current State:**
Test coverage is at 54% (307 unit + 88 integration tests), which is below the project's 70% minimum threshold defined in `build.py`.

**Problems:**
- Missing tests for edge cases and error handling
- Some domain logic may be untested
- Services and repositories might lack comprehensive test coverage
- Integration tests might not cover all user workflows

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Identify Coverage Gaps:**
   - Run `uv run pytest --cov=src/issue_tracker --cov-report=html`
   - Review HTML report to find untested code paths
   - Focus on domain entities, services, and repositories

2. **Prioritize Testing Areas:**
   - **High Priority:** Domain entities and value objects (business logic core)
   - **High Priority:** Service layer (IssueService, IssueGraphService, etc.)
   - **Medium Priority:** Repository implementations and data adapters
   - **Medium Priority:** Error handling paths
   - **Low Priority:** Simple getters/setters and property accessors

3. **Add Missing Test Cases:**
   - Edge cases (empty inputs, null values, boundary conditions)
   - Error conditions (validation failures, constraint violations)
   - Complex business logic (dependency cycles, epic hierarchies)
   - State transitions (issue status changes)

4. **Improve Test Quality:**
   - Use fixtures to reduce test setup duplication
   - Parametrize tests for multiple scenarios
   - Keep tests fast (under 5-second timeout as enforced by build.py)
   - Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order

**Target:**
Achieve at least 70% coverage, with 80-90% coverage on critical business logic (domain and service layers).

**Note:**
The build pipeline enforces coverage thresholds, so this must be addressed before the project can pass CI/CD quality gates.
