SEARCH PROTOCOL (issue-5f8535):\n   - Define standard search() method signature for all skills\n   - Return format: {id, type, content, metadata, score}\n   - Skills expose search via callable API (like notes.search_notes())\n   \n2. FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION (issue-ed1657):\n   - Add 'agent search <query>' command to main CLI\n   - Discover all skills with search capability\n   - Call each skill's search() method in parallel\n   - Aggregate and rank results across skills\n   - Return unified JSON output for LLM consumption\n   \n3. SKILL IMPLEMENTATION (issue-7641eb):\n   - notes: Already has search_notes() - standardize output\n   - issues: Add search() for title, description, comments\n   - planner: Add search() for task descriptions\n   - cache: Add search() for cache keys/values\n   - prompts: Add search() for prompt templates\n   - vacuum: Add search() for knowledge entries\n   - atlas: Add search() for code symbols/functions\n   \nBenefits:\n- LLM can find relevant content across all skills\n- Each result includes skill+ID for direct retrieval\n- Extensible: new skills just implement search()\n- No separate search skill needed",
