# Critical Priority Issues

Currently, there are no critical priority issues that would prevent the application from functioning. However, several high-priority issues related to security and design should be addressed before production use.

The code review found the codebase to be generally well-structured with:
- Good test coverage (84%)
- Clean separation of concerns in most areas
- Proper use of type hints and validation
- Comprehensive documentation in key areas

The issues identified are primarily opportunities for improvement rather than blocking problems.
